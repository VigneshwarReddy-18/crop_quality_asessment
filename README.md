**Crop Quality Assessment Using RGB Segmentation**
Project Overview
This project aims to automate the assessment of crop quality using RGB image segmentation techniques. By analyzing color properties and visual features from RGB images, the system classifies crops based on quality indicators such as ripeness, damage, and disease.


**Introduction**
Manual inspection of crop quality can be subjective and labor-intensive. This project leverages RGB segmentation to provide a more objective and efficient approach. By processing images, the system segments regions of interest, extracts relevant features, and classifies the crops into different quality categories.
Traditional methods of crop quality assessment often involve manual inspection, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. With advancements in computer vision and image processing, RGB image segmentation offers a promising approach for automating this process. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images capture color information that can be used to distinguish different quality parameters in crops.

**Installation:**
cd crop-quality-assessment
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Collection
To use the system, you need a dataset of RGB images of crops. The images should be labeled with quality indicators (e.g., ripe, unripe, damaged). You can collect images using cameras or smartphones under various conditions.

**Usage**
Preprocessing:

Run the preprocessing script to enhance image quality and reduce noise.

python preprocess.py --input_path data/raw --output_path data/processed
Segmentation:

Use the segmentation module to separate the crop from the background and segment regions of interest.

python segment.py --input_path data/processed --output_path data/segmented
Feature Extraction and Classification:

Extract features from segmented images and classify the crops.

python classify.py --input_path data/segmented --output_path results
Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the model using the validation set.
python evaluate.py --input_path results --labels_path data/labels

**Methodology**
Image Preprocessing: Enhance and normalize images for consistent input.
Segmentation: Apply thresholding, clustering, or CNN-based methods to segment the crop and regions of interest.
Feature Extraction: Extract color and texture features relevant to quality assessment.
Classification: Use machine learning models to classify crops into different quality categories.

**Results**
The results include classified images and evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The system provides a reliable assessment of crop quality compared to manual inspection.

**Future Work**
Expansion to multi-spectral imaging for better feature extraction.
Integration with automated machinery for real-time quality control.
Enhancement of the system's adaptability to various crop types.
